# Scope (v1)

Goal: Generate a **classic monthly SEO report** (not over-engineered).

## Included KPIs (recommended baseline)
- Google Search Console (Clicks, Impressions, CTR, Avg. Position, MoM deltas)
- Top Queries (by clicks / impressions)
- Top Pages (by clicks / impressions)
- Core Web Vitals summary (optional, via CrUX/PSI depending on enable flags)
- Action list (rule-based, derived from payload; no invented numbers)

## Non-goals (v1)
- No complex attribution modeling
- No multi-touch analytics
- No custom BI dashboards
- No “creative” AI narratives not grounded in payload
